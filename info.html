  <h1>Connectivity</h1>

  <p>Connectivity is an online sound installation by artist/composer <a href="https://gawainhewitt.co.uk/">Gawain Hewitt</a>.
<br><br>
  When you first enter you are met with an image of the Wigmore Hall Box Office. From here you can click through to the three pieces that make up the installation.</p>

  <h2>Performance</h2>

  <p>In this piece Gawain has created a fictional online Wigmore Hall that performs music made on learning and participation projects led by Wigmore Hall during 2020 and 2021. These projects were all led online, which gives the files a particular sonic aesthetic as internet connections crackle, and different elements are given priority by the Zoom software used to run the sessions. At a time when music making has had to be reimagined, this is a celebration of togetherness and creativity.
    <br><br>
  Each song is accompanied by an image, which is either of the session itself, or a drawing by a participant or an image used as creative inspiration.
  <br><br>
  When you first enter the installation a song is randomly selected. Each time you click on “Click To Load Next Song” button at the top a new song is randomly chosen until you have heard all 13 files in the piece, at which point it will pick again from the full list.
  <br><br>
  It can sometimes take a while to load into this piece as it needs to download relatively large files in order to work.
</p>
  <h2>Conversations</h2>
<p>
  This piece is a collaboration between Gawain Hewitt and <a href="http://www.troupecollective.co.uk">TROUPE</a> and will also feature in their performance <a href="https://wigmore-hall.org.uk/whats-on/conversations-about-music-an-interactive-concert-202106051430">Conversations about Music</a> at Wigmore Hall on the 5th June 2021.
  <br><br>
  In preparing for this work Gawain and TROUPE asked the public to respond to the following questions:
  <br><br>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Is there a particular piece of music you’ve listened to or played a lot during the last 6 months?</li>
    <li>What do you think music is for?</li>
    <li>What is your personal relationship to music?</li>
    <li>Can you tell me about a time music had a profound effect on you?</li>
  <li>Has a musical experience ever surprised you?</li>
  <li>What role has music played for you during the pandemic?</li>
  </ul>




  <p>

  <br>
  This piece shares the responses as an interactive sound piece. Clicking the button plays a randomly selected recording from the responses, creating an evocative and emotional soundscape of music’s power and place in extraordinary times.
</p>
  <h2>Make Music</h2>
      <p>
  In this piece it’s over to you to make music as Wigmore Hall becomes a musical instrument, allowing you to connect with us by making music together.
  <br><br>
  To use this piece click on the chairs to create a sequence and on the faces to switch repeating phrases on and off. You can also speed up and slow down the piece by using the + and – buttons.
  <br><br>
  Pressing the save button will save your work on a new custom web address which you can save or share.
  Just paste it into social media or into a file and you can revisit your work whenever you like.
  Send it to someone else and they can listen to it, or they use it as the start of a new collaborative piece, saving it again with a new link (your own work will still remain as you made it).
  <br><br>
  The sounds are excerpts from music made on learning and participation projects led by Wigmore Hall during 2020 and 2021.
